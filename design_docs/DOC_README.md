# design_docs Index

Canonical index for `design_docs/`. Per DOC_POLICY §5, this file wins over
any other index and is updated in the same session as any doc change.

## Working principles for AI assistants

- Read `../CLAUDE.md` first for repo role, terminology, and don'ts.
- Verify claims against the codebase, not doc-to-doc consistency.
- Plans carry done-conditions, not time estimates.
- `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` is maintainer-owned; surface contradictions,
  do not edit unasked.
- The substrate/system split is load-bearing: geometry and turns in the
  substrate, rules in system plugins. Keep it that way in every doc.
